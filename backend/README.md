# PbS Backend Documentation

## Overview
This is the backend component of the PbS project. It is built using Python and a web framework (Flask or FastAPI) to serve API endpoints for the frontend application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PbS/backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

- To access the API, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api` (or the appropriate endpoint defined in your app).

## Additional Information
Refer to the `app.py` file for details on the available API endpoints and their usage.
